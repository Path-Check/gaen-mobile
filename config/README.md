## Custom Configuration

The PathCheck GAEN mobile project is expected to be configured at build time for
custom branding, copy, links, and assets. To update the configuration update the
files present in this folder.

Before making updates to any `json` file, please validate the contents [here].
An invalid `json` will not be loaded into the application, resulting in no links
being shown.
[here]: https://jsonlint.com/

### Custom Copy:

`config/copy.json`

The supported values are:

- `healthAuthorityName`: This is the display name for the gaen health authority
  associated with the app. This is required as the app provides no default.
- `welcomeMessage`: This is the line that shows up on the welcome screen, right
  above the name of the application `DISPLAY_NAME` on the configuration file. If
  no value is provided, the default is `Welcome to`
- `about`: This will be displayed on the main body of text on the about screen.
  If no value is added, the default message that similar to:
  `The app_name app is developed by the health_authority_name`
- `legal`: This will be displayed on the main body of text for the legal screen,
  by default the name of the application is displayed.

The `json` structure is:

```typescript
type Resource = Partial<Record<Locale.Locale, CustomCopy>> & { en: CustomCopy }

interface CustomCopy {
  welcomeMessage?: string
  about?: string
  legal?: string
  healthAuthorityName: string
}
```

```json
{
  "en": {
    "healthAuthorityName": "Health Authority",
    "welcome_message": "",
    "about": "",
    "legal":,
  },
  "es_PR": {
    "healthAuthorityName": "Autoridad sanitaria",
    "welcome_message": "",
    "about": "",
    "legal": "",
  }
}
```

The application will follow the following steps to determine the correct copy:

1. If the locale and the key for the custom copy exists use that value.

2. If the locale exists but the key for that locale does not default to
the en custom copy key value.

3. If the en custom copy exits, but the key does not exist, return
undefined. (callers are expected to provide the either a default value
or null handling in this case)

4. If the en custom copy does not exist at all return undefined.
(callers are expected to provide the either a default value or null
handling in this case)


### Custom Links

The `links.json` files should have the custom links to display at the bottom
of either the `about` or `legal` contents, and the label value for each one of
the languages supported, defined by the `SUPPORTED_LOCALES` environment
variable.

Each link will be displayed in the same order they are placed in the file and
if no value is added to the current locale displayed in the application, the
link will not be displayed. Meaning that if a locale is missing that link won't
be available in that locale.


The supported screens for links are:

- `about`: These links will be displayed under the main body of text from the
  `copy` values for the about screen.

The `json` structure should be:

```json
{
  "about": [
    {
      "url": "http://www.about.com",
      "label": {
        "en": "About",
        "es_PR": "Acerca"
      }
    },
    {
      "url": "http://www.mission.com",
      "label": {
        "en": "Mission",
        "es_PR": "Mision"
      }
    }
  ],
  "legal": [
    {
      "url": "http://www.about.com",
      "label": {
        "en": "About",
        "es_PR": "Acerca"
      }
    },
    {
      "url": "http://www.eula.com",
      "label": {
        "en": "Terms of service",
        "es_PR": "Terminos de servicio"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

An empty `""` value on a particular locale will result in the link not being
displayed when that language is the active one.


### Brand Colors

`configbrandColors.ts` must define all of the following colors with the exact
format of `export const primary100 = "#123456"`

```
// Primary
export const primary100 = "#4051db"
export const primary110 = "#4754c5"
export const primary125 = "#2434b6"
export const primary150 = "#192591"

// Secondary
export const secondary10 = "#f8f8ff"
export const secondary50 = "#e5e7fa"
export const secondary75 = "#d3d7f8"
export const secondary100 = "#a5affb"
```

Any extra colors will be ignored.
