### Product Analytics Events

This file lists all events recorded if a user opts to
share product analytics information. If a user does not explicitly opt into
sharing product analytics events, the application will not record events.

The application posts analytics events to a remote server defined in the
application config.

Note that this is an optionally enabled feature, and not every build includes
it.
