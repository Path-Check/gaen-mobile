# Project Overview

Help us stop COVID-19.

COVID PathCheck is a mobile app for digital contract tracing (DCT) sponsored by Path Check a nonprofit and developed by a growing global community of engineers, designers, and contributors. PathCheck is based on research originally conducted at the MIT Media Lab.

The PathCheck Google Apple Exposure Notification (GAEN) solution is a full open source system for deploying the GAEN API. PathCheck GAEN includes a customizable mobile app and a production-ready exposure notification server based on the Google open source project.

## Privacy Preserving

Whatâ€™s truly special about PathCheck is our strong commitment to preserving the privacy of individual users. We're building an application that can help contain outbreaks of COVID-19 without forcing users to sacrifice their personal privacy.

See the [Data Dictionary](doc/DATA_DICTIONARY) for a reference of all data that
the app may submit to external services during use.

## Custom Builds

We welcome public health authorities and other organizations implementing digital contact tracing strategies to create custom builds for their specific needs, incorporate PathCheck features into their applications, or create downstream projects that stay linked to the PathCheck project. If intending to fork the repository and develop off of it, be aware that this comes "at your own risk" for continued maintenance.

Certain [customizations](config/README) are available out of the box.

## Broad Non-Developer Community

One of the important aspects of the PathCheck open source project is that it's supported by a large community of volunteers in addition to the open source developer community. Spanning as diverse domains as product management, user research, cryptography, security, compliance, design, and videography more than 1,400 Path Check volunteers are working together to support the project and help drive adoption around the world.

## International

This project is internationalized and can be used in most world communities.

Both imperial and metric unit systems are supported.

The following [locales](src/locales/locale.ts) are supported.

New locales can be supported if translations are provided.

This project is using [Lokalise](https://lokalise.com/) for translations
