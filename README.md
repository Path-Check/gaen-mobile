# Project Overview

This project is a mobile application designed to support contact tracing and
provide a digital pandemic response; it is sponsored by the PathCheck
Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to stopping COVID-19.

This project is open-source; a global community of engineers, designers, and
volunteers have contributed to making this project a reality.

This project uses the Google Apple Exposure Notification
[(GAEN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_Notification) protocol to
facilitate digital contact tracing.


## Privacy Preserving And Secure üîí

The PathCheck Foundation has a strong commitment to privacy and security. We're
building an application that can help contain outbreaks of COVID-19 while
maintaining the highest standards for protecting user privacy.

- See the [Privacy and Security Repo](https://github.com/Path-Check/privacy-security-GAEN)
- See the [Non-Local Data Dictionary](doc/NON_LOCAL_DATA_DICTIONARY.md) for a reference of all data that
the app may submit to external services during use.
- See the [Local Data Dictionary](doc/LOCAL_DATA_DICTIONARY.md) for a reference of all data that
the app stores locally during use.

## Broad Volunteer Community üí™

One of the essential aspects of the PathCheck open source project is support by
a large community of volunteers. We are a diverse group of product managers,
user researchers, cryptography experts, security and compliance experts,
designers, and marketers. More than 2,200 Path Check volunteers are working
together to support the project and help drive adoption worldwide.

Join the Slack organization [PathCheck Slack organization](https://covidsafepaths.slack.com) to get involved.

## Custom Builds üîß

We welcome public health authorities and other organizations implementing
digital contact tracing strategies to create custom builds for their specific
needs, incorporate PathCheck features into their applications, or create
downstream projects that stay linked to the PathCheck project. If intending to
fork the repository, be aware that this comes "at your own risk" for continued
maintenance.

Certain [customizations](config/README.md) are available out of the box.

## Localization üåê

This project is localized and can be used by communities worldwide.

Imperial and metric unit systems are supported.

The following [locales](src/locales/locale.ts) are supported.

This project is using [Lokalise](https://lokalise.com/) for translations.
